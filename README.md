# My personal website

It's based on the Hydeout/Hyde theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Because it's hosted as the GitHub page all the orchestration to compile and push to a webserver it's hidden and managed by Github.

### Dependencies
1. `ruby`
2. `jekyll` and `bundler` gems.


### Usage

Just run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to develop and the website will be served on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). The changes in the `_config.yml` will need the restart of the process but for all the other changes the `--watch` option will watch changes and Jekyll will recompile the static content.

### To do:
- Customize theme ;)

## The CV

The website allows the download of my cv. The CV can be generated and copied from my [cv repo](https://github.com/andreabenfatto/cv.git).
